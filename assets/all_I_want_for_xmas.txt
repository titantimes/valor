I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need

I don't care about the presents
underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need

And I Don't care about the presents
underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
there upon the fireplace

Santa Claus won't make me happy
with a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow

I'm just gonna keep on waiting
underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
to the North Pole for Saint Nick

I won't even stay awake
to hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight

What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
